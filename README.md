# Sudoku

Project - Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic puzzle played on a 9x9 grid subdivided into 9 3x3 subgrids. The player is presented a partially filled puzzle, and must complete it following these rules:

Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats!)
Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats!)
Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats!)

GOAL
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a "sudoku checker". The sudoku checker will be a function that accepts a single sudoku grid (represented by an array of arrays) and returns true if the grid follows the rules above and false if not.
